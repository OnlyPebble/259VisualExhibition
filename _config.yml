description: "Landscape paintings in blue and green colors represent an essential genre of Chinese ink paintings. Based on mineral pigments of blue and green, the blue and green landscape painting genre falls into two types: heavy color and light color. Most blue and green color paintings primarily depict motifs like valleys, hills, forests, and springs.
This exhibition includes a selection of four Blue-and Green landscape paintings from the different dynasties and one traditional long handscroll example by Emperor Huizong. The five collections give us an overview of distinctive artist approaches to blue-and-green landscape paintings and Huizong's artistic influence on Song court paintings."
